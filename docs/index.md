# About Me

_I have many interests; devops/tech/cloud/kubernetes, music, bass guitar, composition and performance. I have included this mkDocs site to maintain my personal website easier than other methods (e.g. wordpress). I figured it's also a cool way to learn and create on things I dig, like github._
