# Michael Colletti 

_I have many interests; devops/cloud/kubernetes/LLMs and GenAI, music, bass guitar, composition and performance. I have included this mkDocs site to maintain my personal website easier than other methods (e.g. wordpress). I figured it's also a cool way to learn and create on things I like, like github._
