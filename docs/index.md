# Michael Colletti 

_I have many interests; devops/cloud/kubernetes/LLMs and GenAI, bass guitar, music composition and performance, and now AI Engineering. I have included this mkDocs static site to maintain my resume(s). It also uses the automation I love to use and learn about. When updated, it gets rebuilt and deployed using github actions._
