# Big Honking DevOps Page of Love: DevOps Notes and Resources
 
#### DevOps Resources

* [DevOpsDays](https://devopsdays.org): Conferences arguably were the structures that germanated the movement's accelerated adoption and cloud. The conferences help ignite the DevOps cultural movement/moment.
 
#### Background
* Germinated as conversations around Agile System Admin practices: @littleidea, @patrickdebois
* MeetUp organized by Patrick Debois in Ghent, Belgium October 2009 [ Decade Anniversary](https://devopsdays.org/events/2019-ghent/welcome/)
 
#### Meta Resources: Talks and Presentations

* [John Willis aka @Botchagalupe](https://gist.github.com/botchagalupe/fa9f8f83c34b6b2dadf5fd54b38a4611) the meta-gist motherlode of DevOps Goodness
* The tremendous influence of Dr. Edwards Deming. Relations to [DevOps](https://itrevolution.com/deming-to-devops-part-1/) See [Profound site Podcast](https://www.profound-deming.com/) the SoPK (System of Profound Knowledge)
 
#### CA(L)MS

* CAMS: *C*ulture, *A*utomation, *M*easurement, *S*haring _ attribution John Willis/Damon Edwards on [DevOps Cafe podcast](https://devopscafe.libsyn.com/) _The L for CA(L)Ms came after the suggestion of Lean by Jez Humble (author of Lean Enterprise/DevOps Handbook) and Daemon Edwards (RunDeck)._
 
* Culture: [Part1](https://itrevolution.com/devops-culture-part-1/) [Part 2](https://itrevolution.com/devops-culture-part-2/)
* Automation
* Measurement
* Sharing
 
* [Netflix Culture Deck](https://sergiocaredda.eu/inspiration/asides/netflix-culture-deck/) and [Patty McCord](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80bymIwYrlI) [TED TALK](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uvG0aCbuG60)
 
#### The Three Ways of DevOps
 
- [Gene Kim's explaination](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nUOXDEvplRc)
- First Way (Flow): Work always flows in one direction – downstream Dev  Ops ala ‘wall of confusion’ Shafer/Thompson
- Second Way (Feedback): Create, shorten and amplify feedback loops (right to left).
- Third Way (Continuous experimentation): Creating a culture that fosters two things: continual experimentation, taking risks and learning from failure; and understanding that repetition and practice is the prerequisite to mastery.
 
- How do these apply to every project/product worked on?
- [IT Revolution](https://itrevolution.com/), as a resource, is just like O'Reilly was for me learning in the early pre-DevOps days. O'Reilly was a go-to then (and now), similarly ITRev offers the texts that will solidify understanding of the challenges beyond technical implementation. The DOES/Enterprise Technology Summits provide that same ecosystem for ideas/ideals to grow and collective ideology around technology. Without these supporting structures/systems would the hegemony. 
 
#### SRE
* What is the role of Site Reliability Engineer? [SRE Book](https://sre.google/sre-book/table-of-contents/) and [SRE Workbook](https://sre.google/workbook/table-of-contents/). [How SRE relates to DevOps](https://sre.google/workbook/how-sre-relates/)
  
#### Configuration Management
* Mark Burgess CFEngine, Promise Theory and how the field of physics informs IT. Burgess pretty much invented modern config management space. By extension heavily influenced Adam Jacob @OPsCode/Chef
_The first time I heard Adam Jacob speak at Velocity 2011, I was struck by how open and generative giving attribution to a hero and influence can be. Mark Burgess, though perhaps less known has had a great influence on the area._
 
#### Config Management Prime-Movers
* Luke Kaines (Puppet)
* Adam Jacob (Chef)
* Michael DeHann (Ansible)
* Mitchell Hashimoto and Armon Dadgar (Terraform)
* Jeff Snover (PowerShell)
 
#### Kim and ITRevolution
* Gene Kim (Visible Ops, ITRevolution, DOES) @realgenekim [When IT Fails](https://www.slideshare.net/realgenekim/when-it-fails-the-business-fails)
 
#### Adrian Cockroft 

* One of my favorite influences in the movement (Sun/Netflix/AWS) Investigate *Chaos Engineering* and more [DevSusOps](https://www.infoq.com/presentations/devsusops/) and the Sustainability tier added to the Well Architected Framework.
* Check his [talks](https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=Adrian+Cockroft+) and [Chaos Eingineering](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lLqASI11Z-M) and [book recommendations](http://a.co/79CGMfB).

#### DORA, Dr. Foresgren, Jez Humble and Accelerate

* [Accelerate](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/accelerate/9781457191435/)
* Jez Humble Continuous Integration/Continuous Delivery (also DORA and Accelerate) [Humble/Farley](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/continuous-delivery-reliable/9780321670250/)
 
_Extremely influencial as a measurement. Currently a measure for an orgs capabilities. There are now 5 current metrics.
 
#### The Five Key DORA Metrics
 
* Deployment Frequency (the frequency at which new releases go to production)
* Lead Time For Changes (the time until a commit goes to production)
* Mean Time to Restore (the time it takes to resolve a service impairment in production)
* Change Failure Rate (the ratio of deployments to production that leads to errors and successful deployments).
* _Operational Excellence / Resilience_ (added 2019)

#### DevSecOps
- James Wickett [DryRun Security](https://www.dryrun.security/)
- Rudgged DevOps Justin Cormack [IAmTheCalvary](https://iamthecavalry.org/)
 
_In the so-called 'DevOps transformation', InfoSec wasn't invited to the party. DevSecOps seeks to fix that and shift security left and embrace more modern patterns of GRC (governance, risk and complience)._
#### Strategy and Wardley
* Simon Wardley: [Wardley Mapping](https://learnwardleymapping.com/) Wardley pioneered the use of mapping as a strategic tool. It can be used for personal goals and strategy and organizational transformation.  It's like he can tell the future and often does. Worth a follow @swardley and [Medium](https://medium.com/wardleymaps/on-being-lost-2ef5f05eb1ec)
 
#### Policy as Code
Emergent with automation and builds pipelines is the notion of declaritive code that enforces policies. While not new these methods of
