### HashiCorp Configuration Language (HCL)

- HCL is a configuration language that is visually and functionally similar to JSON. HCL is designed for infrastructure automation and is intended for use with the Terraform and other HashiCorp products (e.g. Packer) . The expressive power of HCL surpasses that of JSON and YAML. In particular, HCL uses multiple labels to express maps, while JSON and YAML use only single key in maps. Most importantly, HCL allows variables and logic expressions, while JSON and YAML are purely data declarative. This capability gives HCL an edge for keeping code DRY amongst other things. HCL also is a structured configuration language rather than a data structure serialization language (DSL).
