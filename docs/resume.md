## Latest Projects
___

**In 2021 I dove into Cloud and Enterprise Architecture as a Moderization and Migration Architect at a large infrastructure company. I have developed methods of making discovery more effective and streamlining automation for Migration SMEs. My role has permitted me to explore the capabilities of some of the coolest new developments in Kubernetes, AWS, GCP and Azure services, Service Mesh, Moderization, and Migration Tooling. Also I have been able to help teams and orgs with their efforts to promote and leverage modern tool stacks, replacing their legacy infrastructures and practices with more optimal tooling and ways of working. Some of my role is implementing new technologies and discovering product capabilities and use-cases in the open-source and devops toolchains, part as a tool and technology evangelist helping with adoption, and part as a cross-team/geo consultant and advisor for executives and teams.**
