## GenAI-DevOps-Primer Overview

- The inspiration and much of the material for the below GenAI resources comes from none other than [Patrick Debois](https://www.jedi.be/), the Godfather and OG of DevOps cultural movement and DevOpsDays. The first [NYC GenAI DevOps Hackathon](https://www.mongodb.com/community/forums/t/new-york-devops-for-genai-hackathon-nyc/260804) was held on January 24th 2024. Like Ghent in 2009, it was a transitional moment in DevOps: dev,sec,and ops have a cool cousin: data science. Through the last 15 years there have been transformational waves in devops like DevSecOps (security invited to the party) and around 2013 global acceptance then 2016 the global hegemony of devops practices. The addition of LLMs to integrations and new toolings feels very right. The dev/sec/ops frame Patrick provides makes the material even more accessible and understandable. Patrick, as a learner, has a special way of doing this.

- [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/) and [Amazon AWS](https://aws.amazon.com/) sponsored the event. Stacks in the hackathon included using AWS Sagemaker, Kendra, Amazon Q and S3 to create a sample app. MongoDB Atlas and vector databases were focussed and using MongoDB was a highlight as easy-to-deploy. See [MongoDB setup sheet] (all free-tier).
- Takeaway: Working with LLMs and tool integrations with the sensibilities of DevSecOps is the default. Solutions being built by startups have DevSecOps (and now GenAI) sensibilities baked-in. The emergence of models as utility, and the prodigious growth of  and how to create value from unharnessed *unstructured data* for companies holds great promise.

## Significant Papers (a Long list coming soon)

- [Timnit Gebru ](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3442188.3445922) was terminated from Google after the publication of this paper. This was ~2021 before LLMs were as common knowledge.
