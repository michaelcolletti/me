The first NYC GenAI DevOps Hackathon was held on January 24th 2024. Like Ghent in 2009, it was a transitional moment in DevOps: dev,sec,and ops have a cool cousin: data science. Through the last 15 years there have been transformational waves in devops like DevSecOps (security invited to the party) and around 2013 global acceptance then 2016 the global hegemony of devops practices. The addition of LLMs to integrations and new toolings feels very right. The dev/sec/ops frame Patrick provides makes the material even more accessible and understandable. Patrick, as a learner, has a special way of doing this. MongoDB and Amazon AWS sponsored the event. Stacks in the hackathon included using AWS Sagemaker, Kendra, Amazon Q and S3 to create a sample app. MongoDB Atlas and vector databases were focussed and using MongoDB was a highlight as easy-to-deploy. See [MongoDB setup sheet] (all free-tier). Takeaway: Working with LLMs and tool integrations with the sensibilities of DevSecOps is the default. Solutions being built by startups have DevSecOps (and now GenAI) sensibilities baked-in. The emergence of models as utility, and the prodigious growth of and how to create value from unharnessed unstructured data for companies holds great promise.

Stacks in the hackathon included using AWS Sagemaker, Kendra, Amazon Q and S3 to create a sample app. MongoDB Atlas and vector databases were focussed and using MongoDB was a highlight as easy-to-deploy. See [MongoDB setup sheet] (all free-tier). Takeaway: Working with LLMs and tool integrations with the sensibilities of DevSecOps is the default. Solutions being built by startups have DevSecOps (and now GenAI) sensibilities baked-in. The emergence of models as utility, and the prodigious growth of and how to create value from unharnessed unstructured data for companies holds great promise.

But to truly understand Kubernetes, we need to delve into its rich history, starting with its predecessor at Google: Borg. The Borg Era Origins of Borg Developed internally at Google in the early 2000s Purpose: To manage Google's vast array of distributed systems Key features: Resource management, job scheduling, and service discovery Borg Architecture Centralized control plane (Borgmaster) Distributed worker nodes (Borglets) Job descriptions in Borgcfg language Lessons Learned from Borg Importance of declarative configuration Need for a unified API for resource management Value of isolation between applications Birth of Kubernetes From Borg to Kubernetes Initiated in 2014 by Google engineers Goal: Create an open-source system inspired by Borg Initial release: July 21, 2015 Key Contributors Craig McLuckie, Joe Beda, and Brendan Burns (Google) Community involvement through Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF) Architectural Decisions in Kubernetes Control Plane Components API Server Central management point RESTful API for cluster state etcd Distributed key-value store for cluster state Scheduler Assigns pods to nodes based on resource requirements Controller Manager Manages various controllers (Node, Replication, Endpoint, etc.) Node Components Kubelet Ensures containers are running in a pod Container Runtime Software for running containers (e.g., Docker, containerd) Kube-proxy Network proxy and load balancer Networking Model IP-per-pod model CNI (Container Network Interface) for network plugins Storage Persistent Volumes and Persistent Volume Claims StorageClass for dynamic provisioning Critical Inflection Points for Kubernetes Adoption Docker Integration (2015) Kubernetes' ability to work seamlessly with Docker containers Cloud Provider Support (2015-2016) Major cloud providers (AWS, Azure, GCP) offering managed Kubernetes services CNCF Incubation (2016) Kubernetes becomes the first CNCF graduated project Extensibility and Custom Resource Definitions (2017) Allowing users to extend Kubernetes API Stability and Production Readiness (2018) Release of Kubernetes 1.10 with increased stability Simplified Installation and Management (2019) Tools like kubeadm and Helm charts Edge and IoT Support (2020) K3s and MicroK8s for lightweight deployments Improved Security Features (2021) Pod Security Policies and Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) enhancements Design Principles Declarative over Imperative Users declare desired state, Kubernetes handles the rest Modularity and Pluggability Easily extensible architecture Portability Run anywhere: on-premises, public cloud, or hybrid environments Self-healing Automatic placement, restart, and replication of containers Scalability Horizontal scaling of applications and the cluster itself Separation of Concerns Clear distinction between the control plane and worker nodes API-driven All functionality exposed through APIs Immutability Containers and infrastructure treated as immutable entities Similarities to Distributed Systems Configuration Management Kubernetes shares several similarities with traditional distributed systems configuration management tools: Declarative Configuration Like Puppet and Ansible, Kubernetes uses declarative configs Idempotency Operations can be applied multiple times without changing the result Central Control Centralized management of distributed resources Abstraction of Infrastructure Hides complexity of underlying systems Version Control Integration Configurations can be version-controlled (GitOps) Template-based Deployment Use of templates for repeatable deployments (similar to Chef cookbooks) Resource Orchestration Coordinated management of multiple interconnected components State Management Tracking and managing the state of distributed components Beyond Kubernetes: The Future of Container Orchestration As Kubernetes matures, several trends are shaping its future: Serverless Kubernetes Projects like Knative abstracting away more infrastructure details Multi-cluster Management Tools for managing multiple Kubernetes clusters as a single entity AI/ML Integration Enhanced scheduling and autoscaling using machine learning Improved Developer Experience Simplified workflows and tooling for developers Enhanced Security Zero-trust security models and improved isolation techniques Edge Computing Adapting Kubernetes for edge and IoT scenarios FinOps Integration Better cost management and optimization tools Sustainable Computing Focus on energy efficiency and carbon footprint reduction The journey of Kubernetes from its roots in Borg to its current status as the de facto standard for container orchestration is a testament to the power of open-source collaboration and the need for robust, scalable infrastructure management tools in the modern era of cloud computing.","title":"k8s research Part 1"},{"location":"k8s/","text":"Page of

Attending all the Hackathons and learning what I can as fast as possible. The last time I remember things seeming this fast was 30+ years ago with in Perez's Installation period. Web commererce and Internet and distributed systems were are quite the rage but the pace was almost glacial compared to the accelerated advancements of 2024. Needless to say I am furiously learning all the things and documenting a great deal of my work in CPI Labs and pesonal git repos for projects. These include: project Sonteria, Lomaxes Everywhere and several Data projects (DocumentAI, BookMarkBuddy, MailSens)e that will hopefully see better progress with new toolings. In 2021 I dove into Cloud and Enterprise Architecture as a Moderization and Migration Architect at a large infrastructure company. I have developed methods of making discovery more effective and streamlining automation for Migration SMEs. My role has permitted me to explore the capabilities of some of the coolest new developments in Kubernetes, AWS, GCP and Azure services, Service Mesh, Moderization, and Migration Tooling. Also I have been able to help teams and orgs with their efforts to promote and leverage modern tool stacks, replacing their legacy infrastructures and practices with more optimal tooling and ways of working. Some of my role is implementing new technologies and discovering product capabilities and use-cases in the open-source and devops toolchains, part as a tool and technology evangelist helping with adoption, and part as a cross-team/geo consultant and advisor for executives and teams.

Attending all the Hackathons and learning what I can as fast as possible. The last time I remember things seeming this fast was 30+ years ago with in Perez's Installation period. Web commererce and Internet and distributed systems were are quite the rage but the pace was almost glacial compared to the accelerated advancements of 2024. Needless to say I am furiously learning all the things and documenting a great deal of my work in CPI Labs and pesonal git repos for projects. These include: project Sonteria, Lomaxes Everywhere and several Data projects (DocumentAI, BookMarkBuddy, MailSens)e that will hopefully see better progress with new toolings. In 2021 I dove into Cloud and Enterprise Architecture as a Moderization and Migration Architect at a large infrastructure company. I have developed methods of making discovery more effective and streamlining automation for Migration SMEs. My role has permitted me to explore the capabilities of some of the coolest new developments in Kubernetes, AWS, GCP and Azure services, Service Mesh, Moderization, and Migration Tooling. Also I have been able to help teams and orgs with their efforts to promote and leverage modern tool stacks, replacing their legacy infrastructures and practices with more optimal tooling and ways of working. Some of my role is implementing new technologies and discovering product capabilities and use-cases in the open-source and devops toolchains, part as a tool and technology evangelist helping with adoption, and part as a cross-team/geo consultant and advisor for executives and teams.","title":"Latest Projects"},{"location":"resume/#cloud","text":"Google Cloud Certified Google Cloud Engineer and ACE Cert .

I was working in infrastructure, but not th current kind.

Within code I could declaratively build my worlds, just me by my lonesome, create any infrastructure easily just from a text file. Holy S*&t! Temporal Challenge of Ephemeral State: Change and Discovery The coolest part of IaC is that when used adaptively around existing legacy infrastructure, the imperative mode of execution dies hard; the very hard edges around changing how infrastructure state is understood, nevermind managed. Do I change our collective config and push out the changes or do I ssh to the box and fix immediately. There's a temporal challenge: how does one understand the migration estate, real-time, in totality at a fairly high degree of granularity while not having speed or performance degraded by operational challenges of maintaining the means of achieving this. Time State and Consistancy I've adopted Terraform as a mode of creation to solve problems around the domain because it is so fast and adaptable AND can be threaded in existing infrastructures with substantial value gains. The Junction of Other HashiCorp Stack Products Packer as a build tool can establish sanity in th build cycle, making 'build sheets' a thing that has been vastly improved. This is all viable and acheivable and making the configuarion management more easily managed with version control is a great first step.
